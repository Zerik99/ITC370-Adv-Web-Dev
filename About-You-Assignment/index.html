        Hello! My name is Erik Zander. I'm taking this class to gain a better
        understanding in web development. I've done some self teaching through
        YouTube tutorials. My favorite channel is WebDevSimplified; he has great
        information and makes it easy to understand. I do wish there would be
        some more up to date tutorials; sometimes, he has code that is no longer
        valid due to updates. For work, I'm a teller at a bank; however, I was
        recently accepted into an internship with BKD working on Sharepoint
        sites. I'm excited to see if some of the things we learn here will apply
        to the Sharepoint development environment. While SharePoint is low-code,
        I'm sure there are UI/UX design practices that will carry over. For fun,
        I like to tinker with technology and play video games when I have time
        available. I have worked with 3d printing and custom electronics for
        high-end lightsabers. Most recently, I have been exploring custom
        keyboards. The number 1 thing I would like to learn in this course would
        be the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. With these three
        languages, you have the foundation to create and grow into a full
        fledged web developer. Getting started is sometimes the hardest part.

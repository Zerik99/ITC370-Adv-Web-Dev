        <p>
          I have had quite a large number of hobbies come and go throughout the
          past couple years. For example, When covid started to ramp up I
          decided to invest in a 3D printer. I thought I could use the
          technology to help people in my community by 3D printing face shields.
          It would never be a perfect form of protection but it is certainly
          better than nothing! While I wasn't as succesful as some in this
          venture, I'm still proud of the things I was able to accomplish.
          <br />
          Another hobby I'm passionate about is video games. I definitely don't
          have as much time to dedicate to this hobby as I used to but I still
          find time every now and then. Currently, I'm playing Guild wars 2.
          This is a MMORPG set in the world of Tyria. You'll find yourself
          fighting dragons and other fantastical creatures in this game.<br />
          I'll include an image from Guild Wars 2 below.
